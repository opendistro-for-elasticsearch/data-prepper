# Elasticsearch sink

This is the Data Prepper Elasticsearch sink plugin that sends records to Elasticsearch cluster via REST client. You can use the sink to send data to Amazon Elasticsearch Service or Opendistro for Elasticsearch.

## Usages

The Elasticsearch sink should be configured as part of Data Prepper pipeline yaml file.

### Raw span trace analytics

```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
    elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"]
      cert: path/to/cert
      username: YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
      trace_analytics_raw: true
      dlq_file: /your/local/dlq-file
      bulk_size: 4
```

The elasticsearch sink will reserve `otel-v1-apm-span-*` as index pattern and `otel-v1-apm-span` as index alias for record ingestion.

### </a>Service map trace analytics

```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
    elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["https://localhost:9200"]
      cert: path/to/cert
      username: YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
      trace_analytics_service_map: true
      dlq_file: /your/local/dlq-file
      bulk_size: 4
```

The elasticsearch sink will reserve `otel-v1-apm-service-map` as index for record ingestion.

### Amazon Elasticsearch Service

The elasticsearch sink can also be configured for Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain. See [security](security.md) for details.

```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
    elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["https://your-amazon-elasticssearch-service-endpoint"]
      aws_sigv4: true
      cert: path/to/cert
      insecure: false
      trace_analytics_service_map: true
      bulk_size: 4
```

## Configuration

- `hosts`: A list of IP addresses of elasticsearch nodes.

- `cert`(optional): CA certificate that is pem encoded. Accepts both .pem or .crt. This enables the client to trust the CA that has signed the certificate that ODFE is using.
Default is null.

- `aws_sigv4`: A boolean flag to sign the HTTP request with AWS credentials. Only applies to Amazon Elasticsearch Service. See [security](security.md) for details. Default to `false`.

- `aws_region`: A String represents the region of Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain, e.g. us-west-2. Only applies to Amazon Elasticsearch Service. Defaults to `us-east-1`.

- `aws_sts_role_arn`: A IAM role arn which the sink plugin will assume to sign request to Amazon Elasticsearch. If not provided the plugin will use the default credentials.

- `insecure`: A boolean flag to turn off SSL certificate verification. If set to true, CA certificate verification will be turned off and insecure HTTP requests will be sent. Default to `false`.

- `username`(optional): A String of username used in the [internal users](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/security/access-control/users-roles) of ODFE cluster. Default is null.

- `password`(optional): A String of password used in the [internal users](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/security/access-control/users-roles) of ODFE cluster. Default is null.

- `trace_analytics_raw`(optional): A boolean flag indicates APM trace analytics raw span data type. e.g.
```
{
  "traceId":"bQ/2NNEmtuwsGAOR5ntCNw==",
  "spanId":"mnO/qUT5ye4=",
  "name":"io.opentelemetry.auto.servlet-3.0",
  "kind":"SERVER",
  "status":{},
  "startTime":"2020-08-20T05:40:46.041011600Z",
  "endTime":"2020-08-20T05:40:46.089556800Z",
  ...
}
```
Default value is false. Set it to true for [Raw span trace analytics](#raw_span_trace_analytics). Set it to false for [Service map trace analytics](#service_map_trace_analytics).

- `trace_analytics_service_map`(optional): A boolean flag indicates APM trace analytics service map data type. e.g.
```
{
  "hashId": "aQ/2NNEmtuwsGAOR5ntCNwk=",
  "serviceName": "Payment",
  "kind": "Client",
  "target":
  {
    "domain": "Purchase",
    "resource": "Buy"
  },
  "destination":
  {
    "domain": "Purchase",
    "resource": "Buy"
  },
  "traceGroupName": "MakePayement.auto"
}
```
Default value is false. Set it to true for [Service map trace analytics](#service_map_trace_analytics). Set it to false for [Raw span trace analytics](#raw_span_trace_analytics).

- <a name="index"></a>`index`: A String used as index name for custom data type. Applicable and required only If both `trace_analytics_raw` and `trace_analytics_service_map` are set to false.

- <a name="template_file"></a>`template_file`(optional): A json file path to be read as index template for custom data ingestion. The json file content should be the json value of
`"template"` key in the json content of elasticsearch [Index templates API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/index-templates.html),
e.g. [otel-v1-apm-span-index-template.json](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-plugins/elasticsearch/src/main/resources/otel-v1-apm-span-index-template.json)

- `dlq_file`(optional): A String of absolute file path for DLQ failed output records. Defaults to null.
If not provided, failed records will be written into the default data-prepper log file (`logs/Data-Prepper.log`).

- `bulk_size` (optional): A long of bulk size in bulk requests in MB. Default to 5 MB. If set to be less than 0,
all the records received from the upstream prepper at a time will be sent as a single bulk request.
If a single record turns out to be larger than the set bulk size, it will be sent as a bulk request of a single document.

## Metrics

Besides common metrics in [AbstractSink](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-api/src/main/java/com/amazon/dataprepper/model/sink/AbstractSink.java), elasticsearch sink introduces the following custom metrics.

### Timer

- `bulkRequestLatency`: measures latency of sending each bulk request including retries.

### Counter

- `bulkRequestErrors`: measures number of errors encountered in sending bulk requests.
- `documentsSuccess`: measures number of documents successfully sent to ES by bulk requests including retries.
- `documentsSuccessFirstAttempt`: measures number of documents successfully sent to ES by bulk requests on first attempt.
- `documentErrors`: measures number of documents failed to be sent by bulk requests.
